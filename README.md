# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a Python-based calculator that computes the simple interest based on the provided principal amount, time period in years, and annual rate of interest.

## Formula

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

$Simple\ Interest = Principal \times Time \times Rate$

Where:
- **Principal (p)**: The initial amount of money invested or loaned.
- **Time (t)**: The time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.
- **Rate (r)**: The annual rate of interest.

## Usage

To calculate simple interest, provide the following inputs:
- `p` - Principal amount
- `t` - Time period in years
- `r` - Annual rate of interest

## Example

If the principal amount is $1000, the time period is 2 years, and the annual interest rate is 5%, then the simple interest would be calculated as:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = 1000 \times 2 \times 0.05 = 100
\]
